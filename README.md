# Image Classifier In PyTorch

The purpose of this repository is to provide a console application written in python which classifies images according to a deep learning Pytorch model.

## Motivation

This repository attempts to create a generic image classifier application, which can be reused for various domains, instead of creating a new project and repeating much of the same code.

## Package Dependencies

The following python libraries are used in other to aid in the data cleaning and analysis:

* numpy
* argparse
* json
* pytorch 
* torchvision
* PIL

To run this notebook locally, make sure you have Python 3 with the previously mentioned libraries installed.
